            <h3 id="headline">Here's some more about dogs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dog was the first species and only large carnivore to be domesticated which started around 15 000 years ago</li>
                <li>The genetic divergence between dogs and wolves occurred between 20,000 – 40,000 years ago</li>
                <li>First dogs bones was found in Oberkassel, Bonn in Germany with 2 skeletons of human, which are dated for 14 200 years ago</li>
                <li>They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend"</li>
                <li>Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors.</li>
                <li>The smallest known dog was Yorkshire Terrier which was 6.3 cm at the shoulder, 9.5 cm in length and weighed 113 grams</li>
                <li>The largest known dog was Saint Bernard which weighed 167.6 kg and was 250cm from nose to tail</li>
                <li>The tallest dog is Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm at the shoulder</li>
                <li>Dogs are running animals, with the exception of those bred specifically for different purposes. For instance, the Bulldog, with its large head and short, “bowed” legs, cannot be called a creature born to chase game. Most dogs, however, are well equipped to run or lope over long distances, provided that they are physically conditioned for such activities.</li>
                <li>Some studies suggested that dogs can see earth's magnetic field</li>
                <li>Some breeds can born with no tail at all eq. Braque du Bourbonnais</li>
            </ul>
